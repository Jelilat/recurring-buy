# BuyCoins Recurring Buy

[Dollar cost averaging (DCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) is an investment strategy that aims to reduce the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets such as equities. By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g., ₦100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g., ₦1,000 per week over 100 weeks), DCA seeks to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire lump sum just before a fall in the market.
